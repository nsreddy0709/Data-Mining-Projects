This folder contains PCA implementation by using an example of box office dataset.[boxoffice is the dependent variable all others comes under Dependent variable]
The ipynb file answers all these questions
1.	Histograms of the continuous variables (box, budget, starpwr)?
2.	Run a linear regression of box office revenues on the “traditional” variables (i.e. using all the independent variables except the “buzz” varibles), check for statistically significant variables at 0.10 level?
3.	Run another linear regression using only the variables that were significant (again, ignoring the “buzz” variables)?
4.	Plot histograms of the four “buzz” variables.
5.	Run a linear regression of box office revenues on all the independent variables (transformed as needed).
6.	Run another linear regression using only the variables that were significant.
7.	Compare the models developed so far?
8.	Apply Principal Component Analysis to just the 4 “buzz” variables?
9.	Run a linear regression using all the “traditional” independent variables (if transformed, use the transformed versions) and all 4 principal components.
10.	Now run regressions using the number of principal components based on Kaiser’s Rule and “explained variance” thresholds of 60%, 70%, 80% and 90% (if any of the models are identical, point this out and run it only once). Compare all the regression models involving the principal components (including the one involving all four components).
Apply Principal Component Analysis to the 4 “buzz” variables and continuous variables(budget,starpowr)
Regressions using the number of principal components based on Kaiser’s Rule and “explained variance” thresholds of 60%, 70%, 80% and 90% for above question
